# ClimateWins-Weather-Prediction1
Machine learning analysis of European weather data for ClimateWins
# ClimateWins Weather Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains the complete machine learning analysis conducted for ClimateWins as part of Achievement 2 of the *Machine Learning with Python* course. The goal of this project is to explore how machine learning can be used to identify unusual weather patterns in Europe and support long-term climate forecasting and risk assessment.

## Project Objectives
- Identify weather patterns outside regional norms in Europe
- Assess whether unusual weather events are increasing
- Explore possible future weather conditions over the next 25–50 years
- Support decision-making around climate safety and habitability

## Methods Used
- Unsupervised Learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Deep Learning (CNN classification)
- Random Forest models with hyperparameter optimization
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrices, and tree visualization
- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) conceptual exploration

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each exercise
- `scripts/`: Reusable Python scripts for preprocessing and modeling
- `visuals/`: Saved figures and model outputs
- `presentation/`: Final stakeholder presentation
- `reports/`: Written exercise summaries

## Key Findings
- Temperature-related variables were the strongest predictors of extreme weather classes
- Random Forest models provided interpretable feature importance
- Deep learning models showed improved performance after optimization
- GANs were explored conceptually as a future data augmentation strategy

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow / keras
- matplotlib, seaborn
